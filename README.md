# VimRuby
My Configuration to run VIm for Ruby and Ruby on Rails source.

I had based my configuration in this other git repository. https://github.com/janjiss/rcfiles

## How it looks like

[![ScreenShot Editing MarkDown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbandin/VimRuby/master/img/01.png)](#Screenshot)

## Contents

### vim (directory)

This directory will contain the plugins itself, you can rename this directory to ~/.vim.

The plugins may have OS dependencies like ctags or other binaries.

### vimrc (file)

This file is the vimrc file, you can rename this file to ~/.vimrc to enable the plugisn in ~/.vim and other configurations.
There are some OS dependencies like ack-grep, in my case installing ack-grep with brew gave me the ack binary and not ack-grep.

## To do

- Add to README.md pre-requisite configuration.
